    Committng test c file


Due to the fact that this was the first lab of the semester, it wasn't too
technical or data oriented. The goal of the assignment was to fortify some of
the new unix commands and skills that we learned during the in lab exercise.
In certain ways, it was very similar to the in lab exercises. This assignment
entailed, moving around on a remote machine using ssh and unix commands,
manipulating files, creating and extracting tarball, running programs on the
remote machine, and using git.


Having some basic unix skills due to my previous co-op, I didn't have too much
trouble when I was tasked to use VI, move files around, and using ls to view
directory contents. Part A included creating a directory and creating a txt 
file. That text file was edited using VI and I added the required details into
the file. This was pretty straightforward and didn't cause any issues to 
complete. Part B involved using matlab from the remote machine. This is 
something I had never done before, but with the steps given, it wasn't hard to
do and was very interesting to learn for use in the future. Part C applied 
file I/O which I didn't have previous experience with, but after the in lab 
exercise this was pretty fun to do and is a very cool feature of the unix 
commands. It also involved editing a file and creating a copy of that file to
a new text file. The final part, part D was similar to the in lab exercise,
this applied the git version control to the hw01 directory that was created in
part A. Git is something that I am familiar with using. The workflow of 
commits, deletion, and file recovery is something that I have done before. 
This application of git is not how I have used it before. I mostly used git 
with an IDE and it has a GUI for all of the git commands. Using git commands 
in a terminal is good to learn because after it is learned, it can become more
consistent to use instead of relying on a GUI to do everything.


Overall, this was a great first lab to learn how to navigate around a remote
machine using unix commands in the ssh terminal. This applied some of the unix
commands and skills I had learned previously, as well as giving me a new 
perspective on how to use git in the terminal instead of a GUI. I was able to
commit with a message, see the change log, and recover files with git in the 
terminal. This was a good start to editing C files and making changes using
unix provided features.
