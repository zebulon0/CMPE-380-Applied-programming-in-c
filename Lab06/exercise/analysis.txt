/* Explain what the "#if TEST==1" macro does */
The TEST macro is part of the conditional compilation feature of
macros. Essentially the CPP looks for the compile flag -DTEST=1
which defines a simple macro from the command line. Thus creating a macro
called "TEST" and setting it to '1'. Then the CPP sees that TEST==1 so
it executes the conditional code under the line "#if TEST==1".
