/* Choosing the correctional polynomial size */
Since there was no specified order of polynomial to use for the correctional
polynomial, that meant that some testing had to be done. This way I would be
positive that the order of polynomial I chose is the one that best fits the
'ideal' data. To do this, I generated the coefficients for polynomials 
of order 2 through 5. This was done by the help of the hw11.c which takes 
in the realData and finds a solution vector / polynomial for any order.
I tested each order of poly in the correction.c file and ran
'make correct' which calculates the error using detError. I compared that
data from each correctional polynomial as well as comparing each one to 
the base error to make sure that I wasn't taking a step back by increasing
the error. 

In this case each correctional poly reduced the 'Norm of residuals' error, 
and both 'R Squared' and 'Pearson's Correlation' also neared a value of 1. 
This statement was true until I tested a poly of order 5 which ended up with
a larger Norm of residuals error than the previous poly did. This is how I 
ended up using the order 4 correctional polynomial.
