8th order correction polynomial

Normal Mode Least Squared using GSL


**Heavily use pipes '|'

Model the error and then subtract it from the 
input data to produce more accurate results

Minimize the "mid-scale" error and balance the percent error

Output from realDevice piped into diffVal will be the data.txt
Like this??? "./realDevice | diffVal > data.txt"
